I want you to execute the plan I provide by spawning multiple agents.

But before you start the work:
- Go through the plan, analyze it and see how it applies to the project.
- Come up with your execution steps
- Confirm the strategy with me
- After i confirm, start execution.

Three agents need to do the work.

1.  **Agent 1: The Implementer.** Executes the core logic laid out in the plan.
2.  **Agent 2: The Tester.** Writes meaningful tests for the functionality, assuming the implementation will be completed correctly.
3.  **Agent 3: The Documenter.** Updates my project documentation (see /my-feature/README.md in `.ai/docs`) with the new feature being executed.

Assume the other agent will complete the work successfully.
