# MCP Integration Test

## Overview
The superposition_mcp has been successfully converted from a standalone binary to a library crate and integrated into the main superposition application.

## Integration Changes Made

### 1. Library Conversion
- **Created `lib.rs`** with public API for MCP functionality
- **Updated `Cargo.toml`** to support both library and optional binary targets
- **Added feature flags** for standalone usage

### 2. Main App Integration
- **Added dependency** `superposition_mcp = { path = "../superposition_mcp" }` to superposition/Cargo.toml
- **Created MCP module** `src/mcp.rs` with placeholder handlers
- **Added routes** under `/mcp` path in main application

### 3. Available Endpoints
The following MCP endpoints are now available in the main superposition application:

- `GET /mcp/health` - Health check for MCP service
- `POST /mcp` - Main MCP handler
- `POST /mcp/initialize` - MCP initialization
- `POST /mcp/tools/list` - List available tools
- `POST /mcp/tools/call` - Call MCP tools

### 4. Current Status
- âœ… **Compilation**: Both library and main app compile successfully
- âœ… **Routes**: MCP routes are mounted under `/mcp` path
- âœ… **Structure**: Clean separation between library and integration code
- ðŸ”„ **Functionality**: Currently placeholder handlers (ready for full integration)

## Next Steps for Full Integration

1. **Replace placeholder handlers** with actual MCP service calls
2. **Add proper error handling** and middleware integration
3. **Configure authentication** if needed for MCP endpoints
4. **Add tests** for MCP integration
5. **Update documentation** for the new MCP endpoints

## Testing the Integration

To test the MCP endpoints:

```bash
# Start the superposition application
cargo run --package superposition

# Test MCP health endpoint
curl http://localhost:8080/mcp/health

# Test MCP initialization
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/mcp/initialize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1, "method": "initialize", "params": {}}'
```

## Backward Compatibility

The standalone MCP binary is still available with:
```bash
cargo run --package superposition_mcp --features standalone
```
