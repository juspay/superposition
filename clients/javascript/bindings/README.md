# Superposition Native JavaScript Bindings

This package provides native bindings to Javascript (nodeJS) for the Superposition core library that provides functionality for working with [Superposition](https://juspay.io/superposition).

This is used with our [open feature provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/superposition-provider) and we recommend using the provider instead of using this package directly.
