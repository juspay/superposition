**1. Detailed Project Description**

**Project Name:** Superposition (internally also referred to as "CAC" - Context-Aware Configurator, and potentially "juspay_superposition" in build configurations)

**Core Problem Solved:**
The "Superposition" project is designed to provide a comprehensive and dynamic **Context-Aware Configuration (CAC)** management system, coupled with an **Experimentation Platform**. It addresses the challenge of managing complex application configurations that need to vary based on diverse runtime contexts (e.g., user attributes, tenant, location, device) and allows for controlled experimentation with these configurations (e.g., A/B testing, feature flagging).

**Key Aspects and Features:**

*   **Context-Aware Configuration (CAC) System:**
    *   **Dynamic Configuration Resolution:** The primary goal is to serve configurations that are tailored to specific situations or "contexts." Instead of static configuration files, applications can query Superposition with their current context, and Superposition resolves and returns the appropriate configuration values.
    *   **Hierarchical & Composable Configuration Entities:**
        *   **Default Configs:** Define the master list of all known configuration parameters (`keys`), their default values, and a JSON schema for validation. This forms the baseline configuration.
        *   **Dimensions:** Represent attributes or criteria that define a context (e.g., `country_code`, `user_tier`, `device_os`). Each dimension has a name, a JSON schema to validate its values, and an associated priority.
        *   **Contexts:** Specific conditions defined by combining one or more dimensions and their values (e.g., `country_code` is "US" AND `user_tier` is "premium"). Each context is linked to a set of `override` values that modify the `Default Configs` when that context is active. Contexts have a calculated priority based on their constituent dimensions.
        *   **Type Templates:** Reusable JSON schema snippets that can be named and referenced within the schemas of Default Configs or Dimensions, promoting consistency and reusability.
        *   **Functions:** User-defined custom logic (potentially JavaScript, via an abstracted runtime like Deno) that can be associated with Dimensions or Default Configs for advanced validation or dynamic value generation. Functions have a draft/publish lifecycle and can be tested.
    *   **Configuration Resolution Logic:**
        *   When a configuration is requested for a given evaluation context (set of dimension-value pairs):
            1.  Relevant `Default Configs` are loaded.
            2.  All stored `Contexts` whose conditions match the evaluation context are identified.
            3.  The `override` values from these matching contexts are merged based on context `priority` (higher priority contexts take precedence). The `cac_client` crate handles this evaluation and merging, supporting different merge strategies.
            4.  The final resolved configuration (defaults + applied overrides) is returned.
    *   **Versioning:** All significant changes to configuration entities (Contexts, Default Configs, Dimensions, etc.) trigger the creation of a new global configuration version. This allows for retrieving historical configurations and aids in rollback or auditing. The `X-Config-Version` header is used to track this.
    *   **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all changes to configuration entities, queryable via an API with filters for time, table, action, and user. An `X-Audit-Id` header is often returned with responses, linking to the latest audit trail.
    *   **Configuration Reduction:** An advanced feature (`PUT /config/reduce`) to analyze and simplify stored context overrides by removing redundant ones, potentially optimizing storage and evaluation.

*   **Experimentation Platform:**
    *   While not deeply explored yet, `main.rs` and `Cargo.toml` indicate a significant `experimentation_platform` crate and API endpoints (`/experiments`). This platform likely allows for setting up, managing, and evaluating experiments (e.g., A/B tests, feature flags) that can influence the resolved configurations. It's tightly coupled with the CAC system.
    *   Environment variables like `ALLOW_SAME_KEYS_OVERLAPPING_CTX` suggest fine-grained control over how experiment configurations interact with base configurations.

*   **Multi-Tenancy:**
    *   The system is designed to support multiple tenants, configured via environment variables (`TENANTS`).
    *   It uses a `TenantMiddlewareFactory` and `PgSchemaManager`, suggesting tenant identification via request headers/paths and potentially schema-per-tenant or row-level security in the PostgreSQL database.

*   **Technology Stack (evident so far):**
    *   **Backend:** Rust, Actix-web (web framework).
    *   **Frontend:** Rust, Leptos (WASM-based frontend framework).
    *   **Database:** PostgreSQL, accessed via Diesel ORM.
    *   **Data Formats:** JSON (for schemas, context conditions, overrides), Base64 (for function code).
    *   **Schema Validation:** `jsonschema` crate.
    *   **ID Generation:** `rs-snowflake` and `uuid`.
    *   **Deployment:** Likely containerized (implied by extensive use of environment variables).

*   **Unique Aspects:**
    *   **Deep Integration of Configuration and Experimentation:** The system seems to treat experiments as a first-class citizen influencing configurations.
    *   **Sophisticated Context Definition and Priority System:** Allows for fine-grained control over when specific configuration overrides apply.
    *   **Versioned Configurations:** Enables reproducibility and rollback.
    *   **Schema-Driven Configuration:** Extensive use of JSON schemas for Default Configs, Dimensions, and Type Templates enforces structure and validation.
    *   **Extensibility via Custom Functions:** Allows embedding complex logic directly into the configuration management process.
    *   **Configuration Reduction/Optimization API:** A unique feature for maintaining a clean and efficient configuration set.

**Users, Actors, and Entities:**

*   **Users/Actors:**
    *   **Administrators/Developers (System Operators):**
        *   Define and manage `Default Configs`, `Dimensions`, `Contexts`, `Type Templates`, and `Functions` via UI or API.
        *   Set up and monitor `Experiments`.
        *   Query `Audit Logs`.
        *   Trigger `Configuration Reduction`.
    *   **Client Applications/Services (Automated Actors):**
        *   Query the `/config/resolve` endpoint with an evaluation context to get their specific configurations.
        *   Potentially interact with the `Experimentation Platform` to report events or get experiment assignments.
        *   Likely use client libraries (`cac_client`, `experimentation_client`) for these interactions.
    *   **End-Users of Client Applications (Indirect Actors):** Their attributes (e.g., region, user segment) form the evaluation context that client applications send to Superposition, thereby influencing the configuration they experience.

*   **Key Entities (primarily within CAC, Experimentation entities to be further explored):**
    *   **`DefaultConfig`**: A base configuration parameter with a key, default value, schema, and optional associated function.
    *   **`Dimension`**: A criterion for context matching, having a name, priority, schema, and optional associated function.
    *   **`Context` (Definition)**: A specific condition (JSON object of dimension-value pairs) linked to a set of `override` values and a calculated priority.
    *   **`TypeTemplate`**: A named, reusable JSON schema.
    *   **`Function` (Custom Logic)**: User-defined code (e.g., JavaScript) with draft/published states, used for validation or dynamic value generation.
    *   **`Config` (Resolved)**: The final set of configuration values returned to a client for a given evaluation context, including applied overrides and information about matching contexts.
    *   **`ConfigVersion`**: A snapshot of the entire configuration state (defaults, contexts, overrides) at a point in time.
    *   **`EventLog` (AuditLog Entry)**: A record of a change made to a configuration entity.
    *   **`Tenant`**: An isolated environment or customer for which configurations are managed.
    *   **`User` (System User/Admin)**: The identity performing management actions, tracked in audit logs.
    *   **(Presumably for Experimentation) `Experiment`, `Variant`, `FeatureFlag`**: These entities are expected based on the project's scope but need further exploration.

The Superposition project aims to be a robust, flexible, and auditable platform for managing configurations that adapt to varying conditions and for running controlled experiments that can dynamically alter these configurations. Its use of Rust for both backend and frontend (via WASM) is a modern approach.
