**4. Important Classes, Objects, Interfaces, Types, and Module Interactions**

This section details the important programming language-specific constructs (structs, enums, traits, functions, modules) and how they interact within the Superposition project.

**I. Core Data Structures (Primarily from `context_aware_config` and `superposition_types`):**

These are the primary data structures representing the main entities of the system. Many of these have corresponding request/response DTOs in their respective API `types.rs` files.

*   **`DefaultConfig` (DB Model in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields:** `key` (String, PK), `value` (JSON `Value`), `schema` (JSON `Value`), `function_name` (Option<String>), `created_by` (String), `created_at` (NaiveDateTime).
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a base configuration parameter, its default value, and its validation schema.

*   **`Dimension` (DB Model in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields:** `dimension` (String, PK - name), `priority` (i32), `schema` (JSON `Value`), `function_name` (Option<String>), `created_by` (String), `created_at` (NaiveDateTime).
    *   **Purpose:** Defines a criterion for context matching, including its validation schema and priority.

*   **`Context` (DB Model in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields:** `id` (String, PK - hash of `value`), `value` (JSON `Value` - the context condition, e.g., `{"country": "IN"}`), `priority` (i32), `override_id` (String - hash of `override_`), `override_` (JSON `Value` - the configuration overrides for this context), `created_by` (String), `created_at` (NaiveDateTime).
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a specific condition under which a set of configuration overrides should apply.

*   **`Function` (DB Model in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields:** `function_name` (String, PK), `draft_code` (String, Base64), `draft_runtime_version` (String), `draft_edited_by` (String), `draft_edited_at` (NaiveDateTime), `published_code` (Option<String>, Base64), `published_runtime_version` (Option<String>), `published_by` (Option<String>), `published_at` (Option<NaiveDateTime>), `function_description` (String).
    *   **Purpose:** Stores user-defined custom logic (e.g., JavaScript) for advanced validation or dynamic value generation, with a draft/publish lifecycle.

*   **`TypeTemplates` (DB Model in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields:** `type_name` (String, PK), `type_schema` (JSON `Value`), `created_by` (String), `created_at` (NaiveDateTime), `last_modified` (NaiveDateTime).
    *   **Purpose:** Stores named, reusable JSON schema definitions.

*   **`EventLog` (DB Model, likely in `context_aware_config::db::models` or `service_utils`):**
    *   **Fields (inferred from usage):** `id` (UUID, PK), `table_name` (String), `action` (String, e.g., "CREATE", "UPDATE", "DELETE"), `user_name` (String), `timestamp` (NaiveDateTime), `old_value` (Option<JSON `Value`>), `new_value` (Option<JSON `Value`>).
    *   **Purpose:** Records changes to key configuration entities for auditing.

*   **`ConfigVersion` (DB Model, likely in `context_aware_config::db::models`):**
    *   **Fields (inferred from usage):** `id` (i64, PK, auto-incrementing), `config` (JSON `Value` - a snapshot of the entire resolved configuration structure including defaults, contexts, and overrides), `created_at` (NaiveDateTime).
    *   **Purpose:** Stores versioned snapshots of the entire configuration state.

*   **`User` (struct in `superposition_types`):**
    *   **Fields (partially inferred):** `email` (String).
    *   **Purpose:** Represents the authenticated user performing actions, primarily for audit logging and `created_by`/`updated_by` fields. Injected into Actix handlers.

*   **`AppState` (struct in `service_utils::service::types`):**
    *   **Fields:** `db_pool` (`PgSchemaManager`), `default_config_validation_schema` (JSON `Value`), `meta_schema` (JSON `Value`), `cac_host` (String), `cac_version` (String), `experimentation_flags` (`ExperimentationFlags`), `snowflake_generator` (Arc<Mutex<SnowflakeIdGenerator>>), `app_env` (`AppEnv`), `enable_tenant_and_scope` (bool), `tenants` (HashSet<String>), `tenant_middleware_exclusion_list` (HashSet<String>), `service_prefix` (String).
    *   **Purpose:** Shared, read-only application state accessible by all Actix handlers. Initialized at startup.

*   **Request/Response DTOs (various `*Req`, `*Resp` structs in `crates/context_aware_config/src/api/*/types.rs`):**
    *   These structs define the expected JSON payloads for API requests and the structure of JSON responses. They derive `serde::{Serialize, Deserialize}`. Examples: `PutReq` for contexts, `CreateReq` for dimensions, `TypeTemplateRequest`, `CreateFunctionRequest`, etc.

*   **`caclang::ContextAwareConfig` (struct in `crates/caclang/src/lib.rs`):**
    *   **Fields:** `dimensions` (`caclang::Dimensions`), `default_config` (`toml::Table`), `contexts` (`caclang::Contexts`).
    *   **Purpose:** Represents a configuration defined entirely within a TOML file, parsable and evaluatable by the `caclang` crate. This seems to be a separate mechanism for defining configurations, potentially for seeding or offline processing, distinct from the API-driven database entities.

**II. Key Modules/Packages/Subsystems and Interactions:**

Refer to **Task 2: Identified Subsystems** for a high-level overview. Here we detail interactions:

1.  **`superposition` (Main Application Crate):**
    *   **Interaction:** Orchestrates all other crates. Initializes `AppState`. Sets up Actix-web server, routing all API requests to either `context_aware_config` or `experimentation_platform` handlers. Serves the `frontend` (Leptos app).
    *   **Service Contracts:** Uses the `endpoints()` functions exposed by `context_aware_config::api::*` modules and `experimentation_platform::api::experiments::endpoints()` to configure Actix routing.

2.  **`context_aware_config` (CAC Management Crate):**
    *   **Internal Module Structure:**
        *   `api/`: Contains submodules for each API resource (`context`, `dimension`, `default_config`, `config`, `functions`, `type_templates`, `audit_log`). Each resource module typically has:
            *   `handlers.rs`: Implements Actix request handlers.
            *   `types.rs`: Defines request/response DTOs.
            *   (Sometimes) `helpers.rs`: Utility functions specific to that resource.
        *   `db/`: Contains database schema definitions (`schema.rs` via Diesel) and model structs (`models.rs`).
        *   `helpers.rs`: Crate-wide helper functions (e.g., `generate_cac`, JSON schema validation wrappers).
        *   `middlewares.rs`: (Potentially, though not explicitly seen in detail yet for this crate itself, but `superposition` uses middlewares that affect it).
        *   `validation_functions.rs`: Likely contains logic for `compile_fn` and `execute_fn` used by the `functions` API, possibly interacting with Deno or another JavaScript runtime.
    *   **Interactions:**
        *   **With Database:** All API handlers interact extensively with the PostgreSQL database via Diesel (CRUD operations on `DefaultConfig`, `Dimension`, `Context`, `Function`, `TypeTemplates`, `EventLog`, `ConfigVersion` tables).
        *   **With `service_utils`:** Uses `DbConnection`, `PgSchemaManager`, `AppState`, `CustomHeaders`, `AppHeader`, and helper functions like `parse_config_tags`.
        *   **With `superposition_types`:** Uses shared error types (`AppError`) and the `User` struct.
        *   **With `superposition_macros`:** Uses procedural macros for boilerplate error generation.
        *   **With `cac_client`:** The `/config` API handler delegates core config evaluation logic to `eval_cac` / `eval_cac_with_reasoning` from this client.
        *   **With `caclang`:** Potentially for parsing/validating parts of function code or complex schema types if `caclang`'s TOML structures are involved in any API payload or internal representation (though primary interaction seems DB-first via API). The `validate_value_with_function` and `compile_fn` in `context_aware_config` might ultimately invoke parts of `caclang` or a similar custom script/expression engine.
    *   **Service Contracts:** Exposes `endpoints()` functions from its `api` submodules, which return Actix `Scope` objects for routing.

3.  **`experimentation_platform` (Experimentation Management Crate):**
    *   **Internal Module Structure (Inferred):** Likely similar to `context_aware_config` with `api/experiments/handlers.rs` and `api/experiments/types.rs`, and a `db` module.
    *   **Interactions (Inferred):**
        *   **With Database:** For storing experiment definitions, variants, targeting rules.
        *   **With `context_aware_config` / `cac_client`:** Crucially, experiments will need to influence the final configuration. This could happen by:
            *   The Experimentation Platform defining its own `Contexts` (with high priority) that override CAC-defined configurations.
            *   The `cac_client::eval_cac` logic being aware of active experiments and applying their variant-specific overrides.
        *   **With `service_utils`:** For DB connections, shared types.
    *   **Service Contracts:** Exposes `endpoints()` for `/experiments` routes.

4.  **`frontend` (Leptos UI Crate):**
    *   **Interaction:**
        *   Makes HTTP requests (likely via Leptos server functions proxied through `/fxn/...`) to the backend APIs (exposed by `superposition`) to manage CAC entities and experiments.
        *   Renders UI components based on data fetched from the backend.
    *   **Service Contracts:** Adheres to the API contracts defined by the backend `/context/*`, `/dimension/*`, `/default-config/*`, `/function/*`, `/types/*`, `/audit/*`, and `/experiments/*` endpoints.

5.  **`service_utils` (Shared Utilities Crate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides common functionalities.
    *   **Key Exports (used by other crates):**
        *   `db::pgschema_manager::PgSchemaManager`: Manages DB connection pools, potentially with schema-per-tenant/scope logic.
        *   `db::utils::init_pool_manager`: Initializes the `PgSchemaManager`.
        *   `service::types::{AppState, AppEnv, AppScope, CustomHeaders, AppHeader, DbConnection, ExperimentationFlags}`: Core shared types.
        *   `middlewares::*`: `AppExecutionScopeMiddlewareFactory`, `TenantMiddlewareFactory`.
        *   `helpers::*`: Utility functions like `get_from_env_unsafe`, `deserialize_stringified_list`, `parse_config_tags`.
    *   **Interaction:** Consumed by `superposition`, `context_aware_config`, and `experimentation_platform`.

6.  **`superposition_types` (Shared Data Types Crate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines common Rust types used across the workspace, especially for results and errors.
    *   **Key Exports:** `User` struct, `superposition::Result` (likely `std::result::Result<T, AppError>`), `AppError` enum.
    *   **Interaction:** Used by most backend crates.

7.  **`superposition_macros` (Procedural Macros Crate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Defines procedural macros to reduce boilerplate, likely for error handling (e.g., `bad_argument!`, `db_error!`).
    *   **Interaction:** Used by `context_aware_config` and potentially other backend crates.

8.  **`cac_client` (Context-Aware Config Client Crate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides an interface for evaluating configurations. Crucially, it seems to contain the core algorithm for merging default configs with context-specific overrides based on a given evaluation context.
    *   **Key Exports:** `eval_cac`, `eval_cac_with_reasoning`, `MergeStrategy`.
    *   **Interaction:** Used by `context_aware_config::api::config::handlers` for resolving configurations. Also intended for external services to consume configurations.

9.  **`caclang` (CAC Language Crate):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a parser and evaluator for a TOML-based configuration definition language. This allows defining dimensions, default configs, and context rules (conditions and overrides) in TOML files.
    *   **Key Exports:** `ContextAwareConfig::parse()`, `ContextAwareConfig::get_config()`.
    *   **Interaction:**
        *   Its direct usage within the main API flow of `superposition` is not immediately obvious from the `context_aware_config` API handlers, which are database-centric.
        *   It could be used for:
            *   An alternative way to load/bootstrap configurations (e.g., from a file by an admin tool, then persisted to DB via APIs).
            *   Internal testing or validation of configuration logic.
            *   The `validation_functions` module (which handles custom JavaScript functions) might leverage `caclang` or `evalexpr` (which `caclang` uses) for parsing or evaluating parts of the function logic or associated metadata if it's expressed in a similar syntax.

**Common Patterns:**

*   **Modular API Design:** Each resource (context, dimension, etc.) has its own module with `handlers.rs` and `types.rs`.
*   **Diesel for DB Interaction:** Consistent use of Diesel for all PostgreSQL operations.
*   **Serde for JSON:** Universal for API request/response serialization/deserialization.
*   **Centralized `AppState`:** For sharing application-wide resources like DB pools and global configs.
*   **Custom Error Handling:** `AppError` enum and procedural macros for structured error responses.
*   **Transaction Management:** Write operations are wrapped in DB transactions for atomicity.
*   **Configuration Versioning:** Changes to configuration data often result in a new version ID being generated and returned in headers.
*   **Base64 for Function Code:** Custom logic is stored encoded.
*   **JSON Schema Validation:** For `DefaultConfig` values, `Dimension` values, `TypeTemplate` schemas, and even the schemas themselves (meta-validation).
*   **TOML for `caclang`:** A separate DSL defined in TOML for configuration that `caclang` can parse and evaluate.

**Service Contracts:**
*   **HTTP API:** The primary contract is the RESTful API exposed by the `superposition` service. Request/response structures are defined by the DTOs in various `types.rs` files.
*   **`cac_client` Crate:** Defines a Rust API (`eval_cac`, etc.) for programmatically resolving configurations. This is an internal service contract used by the `/config` endpoint and potentially by external Rust-based clients.
*   **`caclang` Crate:** Defines a contract based on the TOML file structure it expects for parsing configurations.

The system is highly structured, with clear separation of concerns into different crates and modules. The `context_aware_config` crate forms the heart of the configuration management, while `experimentation_platform` builds upon it. `service_utils`, `superposition_types`, and `superposition_macros` provide foundational support. The `caclang` crate offers a file-based DSL for configuration which might be used for bulk loading or an alternative definition path.
