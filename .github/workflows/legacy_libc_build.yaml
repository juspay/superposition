    # Disable incremental compilation.
    #
    # Incremental compilation is useful as part of an edit-build-test-edit cycle,
    # as it lets the compiler avoid recompiling code that hasn't changed. However,
    # on CI, we're not making small edits; we're almost always building the entire
    # project from scratch. Thus, incremental compilation on CI actually
    # introduces *additional* overhead to support making future builds
    # faster...but no future builds will ever occur in any given CI environment.
