Hey, I wanted to talk about my work in general. Tbh, I don't think I am even contributing anything nowdays, I come up with tickets/issues to work on, which gets distributed among folks, then there is other development stuff folks are doing. The PRs are opened they get merged I don't even go through most of them, its a problem on my end, too de-motivated while reviewing the PR, there are endless discussions for everything (I am tired of this), endless arguments and solutioning, makes me do half-hearted PR reviews.
In the end the PRs are merged I am out of sync, I open code-base I see endless problems again.
Maybe I am not gelling with the team well, not getting my words/opinions across. I know I cannot dictate my opinion, but honestly what I feel is, there are too many opinions at the same time, if I write a solution, during reviews I try my best that my coding style should win, then comes other person's PR
I am just venting out the frustration
